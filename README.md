Project Description: Flask-Based Search Model with FAISS Vector Stores for Small Language Model

This project involves building a search application with a Flask backend, designed to efficiently retrieve information from a corpus of text, specifically three pieces of an OS (Operating Systems) book. The system leverages FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for vector storage and retrieval, enhancing the performance of a small language model. FAISS enables fast and scalable similarity search by converting text into high-dimensional vectors, allowing the model to efficiently find relevant content based on user queries. The Flask backend handles API requests, processes search queries, and interfaces with the FAISS vector store to deliver accurate and rapid search results, optimizing the small language modelâ€™s capabilities for text retrieval tasks.
